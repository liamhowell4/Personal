Project: Build Your Own World (BYOW)

-------------------------
Introduction
-------------------------
This project uses a world building algorithm to play an escape game, idea designed by
UC Berkeley's CS61B course, and implementation designed by Wil Aquino and Liam Howell.

Upon entering the main GUI of the program, there are three options:
1. New Game (N)
2. Load Game (L)
3. Quit (Q)

These three menus will be explained shortly, but it is to be noted that most functionality
is implemented through keyboard inputs. Once the world is generated, the user may move
within the world using the standard "WASD" control scheme for moving. The game is won and ends
once the user navigates to the exit.

Otherwise, the user can save and quit the program by pressing ':' followed by 'Q', '1', '2', '3',
or '4' (See the tip in the New Game menu to learn more).

Hovering over certain tiles with the mouse also reveals information about that tile in the
top-left corner.

Instructions
-------------------------
NEW GAME (N):
Upon entering the new game screen by pressing 'N', the user is prompted with a seed to input.
This seed may be in the form of numbers and numbers only. Upon finishing the seed input by
pressing 'S', the world generation is complete, and the user can now move in it.

LOAD GAME (L):
Upon entering the load game screen by pressing 'L', the user is prompted with a number save
slot to load, unless there are no saves available. Upon loading one of the slots by pressing
'0', '1', '2', '3', or '4' (depending on how many slots there are available), the world generates
the saved world, and the world generation is complete; the user can now move in it.

QUIT (Q):
By pressing 'Q', the user quits the game and is prompted to close the window.
